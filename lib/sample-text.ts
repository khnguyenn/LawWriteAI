Dear Ms Martinez,
Re: Preliminary Advice Regarding Conduct of Thompson & Co
We refer to your instructions regarding the conduct of Thompson & Co in your family law property settlement matter. Based on the information provided, we have identified several potential breaches of professional obligations under the Legal Profession Uniform Law (NSW) and the Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015 (“Conduct Rules”), which may give rise to regulatory complaints and civil claims.
1. Potential Breaches of Professional Obligations
a. Duty of Confidentiality – Rule 9
You disclosed sensitive financial information to Thompson & Co, including the transfer of earnings to an offshore account. You later discovered that this information was shared with Mr David Chen, a third party, via lawyers within Thompson & Co acting in a separate matter.
Under Rule 9.1 of the Conduct Rules, a solicitor must not disclose any information which is confidential to a client acquired during the engagement, unless authorised or required by law 
The unauthorised disclosure of your financial arrangements constitutes a prima facie breach of this rule.
In Legal Services Commissioner v Coleman [2004] NSWADT 170, the solicitor was struck off for breaching client confidentiality by disclosing privileged information to a third party, which was found to be professional misconduct
b. Conflict of Interest – Rules 10 & 11
Thompson & Co commenced acting for Mr Chen in March 2024 while continuing to represent you in a matter involving shared business interests with Mr Chen. This raises serious concerns under Rule 11, which prohibits solicitors from acting for multiple clients in related matters where their interests conflict, unless informed consent is obtained and effective information barriers are in place 
The failure to disclose this dual representation and obtain your informed consent may constitute professional misconduct under s 297 of the Legal Profession Uniform Law (NSW). In Malouf v Constantinou [2017] NSWSC 923, the Supreme Court of NSW emphasised that solicitors must avoid situations where their personal or professional interests conflict with those of their clients 
c. Duty to Act in Client’s Best Interests – Rule 4.1.1
Solicitors must act in the best interests of their client
Your concerns about inadequate advice and lack of explanation regarding the settlement terms may indicate a breach. In Legal Services Commissioner v Nguyen [2008] LPT 12, failure to communicate effectively with a client was found to be unsatisfactory professional conduct 
d. Duty to Communicate Clearly – Rule 7.1
You indicated that the settlement was not properly explained to you and that you were not in a sound state of mind when agreeing to it. Under Rule 7.1, solicitors must provide clear and timely advice to assist clients in understanding legal issues and making informed decisions 
In Chetri & Thapa [2024] FedCFamC2F 1611, the Federal Circuit and Family Court found that a financial agreement was not binding due to the wife not receiving proper, independent legal advice. The solicitor failed to advise on entitlements and obligations, and the court held that enforcing the agreement would be unjust and inequitable 
This case illustrates that inadequate legal advice may justify setting aside a settlement under s 90G(1A) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth).
2. Regulatory Complaint Options
You may lodge a complaint with the Office of the NSW Legal Services Commissioner (OLSC). The process involves:
•	Preliminary assessment
•	Informal resolution attempts
•	Formal determination, which may include orders for apology, fee reduction, retraining, or compensation
•	Referral to NCAT for serious disciplinary matters 
Complaints must be made within three years of the alleged conduct, although extensions may be granted in limited circumstances 
3. Challenging the Property Settlement
Under Section 79A of the Family Law Act 1975, a property settlement order may be set aside if there has been a miscarriage of justice, including:
•	Fraud or suppression of evidence
•	Duress or undue influence
•	Unconscionable conduct
•	Failure to disclose relevant financial information 
Your statement that you were not in a proper mental state to agree to the settlement, combined with the lack of explanation and potential conflict of interest, may support an application under s 79A(1)(a). In Thorne v Kennedy (2017) FLC 93-807, the High Court set aside a financial agreement due to undue influence and unconscionable conduct
However, the court retains discretion and will require substantial evidence to set aside the order. A psychological report and detailed affidavit may strengthen your case.
Next Steps
We recommend the following actions:
1.	Prepare a formal complaint to the OLSC outlining the breaches.
2.	Review the settlement documents and correspondence for evidence of inadequate advice.
3.	Consider civil remedies, including a claim for professional negligence or breach of fiduciary duty.
4.	Explore options to reopen the property settlement through the Family Court.
Please let us know if you would like assistance with any of these steps.
